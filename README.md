Tools to easify source-code navigation

* a quick grep-based search for any codebase that avoids build files, node_modules, and large binary files
* a quick find-based filename search for any codebase
* tools to quickly open & edit files
* tools to quickly and automatically build & run
* aliases for common git commands, build functions
* scripts for common tasks, such as watching & filtering output

### NOTE

This is overdue for an update. These tools really need to be formalized and reorganized.
